# Orientation for PYTHON210B, Autumn 2018 (September 26, 2018)

## Topics

### UW PCE learning environment

* Make sure you set up your UWNetID and receive emails to your `myUWNetID@uw.edu` email address!
* Course LMS (Learning Management System): [Canvas for this course](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1231462/) 
* Email announcement: Through [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jma0wi35h6sfu) (your `@uw.edu` email address should just work with this, after signing up on invitation)
  * This may be replaced with the Canvas announcements, but for now, please stay tuned to this Piazza email announcement as well
* Zoom online meeting [link](https://washington.zoom.us/my/python2018): For remote class/office hours participation, also for in-class volunteer demo sharing purpose--volunteer needed for today's demo!

### Set up Python programming environment: Python, modules, git

* [Windows](https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/supplemental/installing/python_for_windows.html)
  * Python 3.7 (64-bit recommended): [link](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0-amd64.exe)
    * Pay attention to the installation location and other options...
  * [gitbash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
    * Git editor choice might be interesting (have never done this myself)
    * Also the CR-LF conversion setting...
    * Also the python alias (to cope with the hanging command line execution)
  * pip, ipython (modules): Follow the python commands in the page
  * I'd like all this to be demoed over Zoom, so a volunteer is requested!
* [Mac](https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/supplemental/installing/python_for_mac.html)
  * Need some help from a Mac owner!
* [Linux](https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/supplemental/installing/python_for_linux.html)
  * Does anyone use Linux as desktop/GUI-purpose (not a cynic/sarcastic question, but I'm serious)

### Optional: Editor

* Sublime or Atom: [link](https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/supplemental/dev_environment/index.html#minimum-requirements)
  * Not endorsed or supported officially, but we are here to help/support in collaboration.
* Visual Studio Code: [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * Need a little more (extensions) for Python: [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
  * Again, not officially endorsed or supported, but I myself (instructor) will use this throughout the course.
  * I'd say it's an editor (light-weight), which is almost like an IDE (features), so I personally use this most of the time.
  * Settings:
    * Render whitespace to All
    * Shell:Windows to bash path
